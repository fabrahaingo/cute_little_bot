## That's it !

Don't forget that you'll still need to **manually select your tickets** once the link is found !

When you're done with your booking, click on your Terminal window and hit `Command + C` to kill the program.

### Features to implement:
- [X] Auto ticket selector
- [X] If login fails, retries instead of having to restart the program
- [ ] Capcha solver
- [ ] Check user's inputs
- [ ] Better way to notify user when a link is found
